# CaloriEx: Yet Another Calorie Tracker

## That includes exercises :)


As of right now, this project will implement a calorie tracker via user inputs of meals 
that consist of a Title, for example *Spaghetti and Meatballs*, along with calorie count
in addition to an optional description.

This tracker also consists of a record of exercises, which similar to the meal tracker will
consist of a Title, for example *Badminton* plus a count burned calories, along with an optional description

More features/other things might be implemented later. :)


## User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to
- add a meal to a day
- add an exercise to a day
- view meals eaten in a day
- view exercises done in a day
- view all details about all meals eaten in a day
- view all details about all exercises eaten in a day
- total the number of calories in versus calories out for a day (if any at all. (looks at self in shame))
- save data to files
- load data from files

##Phase 4: Task 2
The task chosen to be implemented is: Test and design a class in your model package that is robust.

The constructor of the Day class is now robust.
